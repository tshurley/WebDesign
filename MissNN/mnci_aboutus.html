        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div class="clr"></div>
        <p>Welcome to the Official Miss Navajo Council, Inc. website. This site is dedicated to all the former Miss Navajos. The role of Miss Navajo Nation is to exemplify the essence and characters of First Woman, White Shell Woman and Changing Woman and to display leadership as the Goodwill Ambassador. Miss Navajo Nation represents womanhood and fulfills the role of "grandmother, mother, aunt, and sister" to the Navajo people and therefore she can speak as a leader, teacher, counselor, advisor and friend. In March 1999, the Branch Chiefs of the Navajo government agreed that one of the fundamental principles of the Navajo government should be the preservation of Navajo culture.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <div class="clr"></div>
        <p>The Miss Navajo Council, Incorporated (MNC, Inc.) is a non-profit organization, which is independent of the Navajo Nation government. The Miss Navajo Council Inc. recognizes all titleholders known as Miss Traditional Navajo, Miss Modern Navajo, Miss Navajo, and Miss Navajo Nation.</p>

		<blockquote>
		<p><strong>To promote the preservation of Dine/Navajo language, culture, and tradition; more specifically to advocate for the enduring qualities, which identify Dine/Navajo woman as the foundation, strength, and keeper of cultural teachings as established by Yoolgaai Asdzaan-White Shell Woman and Hotaa’ Baazhni’aazh—Hero Twins’ Journey to the Sun.</strong></p>
		<!--<P>To serve as an advisory council to the current Miss Navajo Nation and the Office of Miss Navajo Nation, and to actively participate in aiding the current Miss Navajo Nation in accomplishing her platform and the mission of the Office of Miss Navajo Nation.</P>-->
		<p>To promote and foster partnerships between former Miss Navajo Nations and Dine/Navajo community including elders, youth, students, educators, government entities, and businesses.</P>
		<p>To perform all other usual and customary functions of a corporation.</p>
	</blockquote>

		<h2>Our History</h2>
		<div class="clr"></div>
		<p>In the fall of 2004, Sarah Johnson Luther (Miss Navajo 1966-1967) and Sunny Dooley (Miss Navajo Nation 1982-1983) reached out to former Miss Navajos (from 1952 to the present) who has successfully completed their year of reign and began the process of forming an organization of former titleholders. Both strongly felt all 64 former Miss Navajos, who are well versed in the Navajo language, culture, tradition and in the contemporary world, would make a unique resource and could be of service to the Navajo Nation. Many of the former titleholders are homemakers with children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. They also represent many professional careers as doctors, educators, nurses, administrators, storytellers, linguists, ranchers, artists and some have served with distinction in the armed forces.</p>
